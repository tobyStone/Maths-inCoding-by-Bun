Prerequisites:
Ensure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your computer. If not, you can download and install them from nodejs.org.

Create a GitHub account for hosting your project repository.

Step 1: Create Your Node.js Project
Open your terminal/command prompt and navigate to the directory where you want to create your project.

Create a new Node.js project using npm. Run the following command and follow the prompts:

bash
Copy code
npm init
Install any necessary packages and set up your project structure as needed. For your math quiz project, make sure to include your HTML, CSS, JavaScript files, and other assets.

Step 2: Initialize a Git Repository
Initialize a Git repository in your project folder:

bash
Copy code
git init
Create a .gitignore file to specify which files or directories you want to exclude from version control. You can use a template like GitHub's Node.gitignore to get started.

Add your changes to Git and make an initial commit:

bash
Copy code
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
Step 3: Set Up a GitHub Repository
Go to GitHub and log in to your account.

Click the '+' icon in the upper right corner and select 'New Repository'.

Fill in the repository name, description, and other settings as needed.

Follow the instructions to push your local repository to GitHub. You'll need to copy the commands provided under the "…or push an existing repository from the command line" section on GitHub.

Step 4: Deploy to Vercel
Go to Vercel and sign in with your GitHub account.

Click the 'Import Project' button.

In the 'Import Git Repository' section, select your GitHub repository for the Node.js project.

Configure your deployment settings, such as the branch to deploy and other project settings.

Click the 'Deploy' button. Vercel will build and deploy your Node.js project.

Once the deployment is successful, you'll receive a Vercel deployment URL. You can access your project through this URL.

Step 5: Deploy to GitHub Pages
Create a docs folder in your Node.js project directory (if it doesn't already exist).

Move your HTML, CSS, and other project files into the docs folder.

Commit your changes:

bash
Copy code
git add .
git commit -m "Prepare for GitHub Pages deployment"
Push your changes to GitHub:

bash
Copy code
git push origin master
Go to your GitHub repository's settings.

Scroll down to the GitHub Pages section, and select the master branch as the source for GitHub Pages.

Save your changes, and GitHub Pages will host your project using the docs folder.

After completing these steps, your project will be deployed on Vercel, and a separate copy will be hosted on GitHub Pages. You can access your project via both the Vercel deployment URL and the GitHub Pages URL.
