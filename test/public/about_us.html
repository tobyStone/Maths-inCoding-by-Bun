            <h2>About Maths inCoding</h2>
            <p>
                Ryan (the one who looks a lot like a younger Bill Gates) is a web developer and Toby (the one who doesn't) is a maths
                and programming teacher who have combined to teach students maths through coding computer games.
            </p>
            <p>
                Toby has taught maths to students inside and outside of the school system and noticed that many who wouldn't learn from textbooks, would
                learn maths to code their computer games. Ryan - who has coded for longer than it looks like he's been alive - has guided the building of this website,
                a website to help students learn mathematics while making games they want to show off and play.
